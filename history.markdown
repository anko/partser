This library began as a fork of Jeanine Atkinsson and Han Seoul-Oh's most
excellent [Parsimmon](https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon) parser combinator
library and still retains lots of naming and the core of its implementation
from there.  I forked because I wanted to see how far I could push the
ultramodular parser idea, and it was definitely out of scope for Parsimmon.
